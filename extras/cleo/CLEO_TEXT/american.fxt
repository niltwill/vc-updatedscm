MOB21_H Okay, what about her?
MOB45_A Tommy, we gotta talk about stuff.
MOB45_B What's the problem, Lance?
MOB45_C It's you, my friend, I feel you're not giving me a fair slice!
MOB45_H Tommy, I've done everything for you, you treat me like a fool. Don't do that!
MOB45_I Lance, I won't rip you off or stab you in the back, OK? Just take it easy.
MOB45_J This is tough enough without you getting all emotional on me.
MOB45_K Trust me. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
MOB45_M Lance, don't be like this. Now I'm warning you. Do you hear me?
MOB45_N Just relax, take a few days off. OK? I'll talk to you.
MOB46_E Nothing. Just to say, you know. Look Tommy,
MOB46_F we can do this thing. You and me, no problem. You know what I mean?
MOB52_A Hey, uh, Leo, I think we got a buyer for Diaz's merchandise.
MOB52_D You OK, Leo? You sound kinda different.
MOB56_A Tommy, I heard you killed Ricardo Diaz.
MOB56_B No, there was an unfortunate fire at his mansion.
MOB56_C I think he might have burnt to death in his acrylic shirt.
MOB56_D Tommy, I'm so proud of you. I knew you were a real man.
MOB56_E He was an awful trouser stain of a man, you make me so proud to be your friend.
MOB56_F I know you're going to be busy trying to take over this town, but don't forget about me, you hear?
MOB57_A It's Mercedes. I no longer love you Tommy.
MOB58_C Hey indeed Mr. Tough Guy! I'm really angry with you Tommy!
MOB58_D Never make me hang out with Jezz Torrent again. He's pathetic.
MOB58_E Half way through he starts crying about his doggie it dies when he's 7 years old and that his mommy never loved him.
MOB58_F And Tommy, he wears a wig and a bra in private.
MOB58_G I am not very happy with you! I'm very, very angry. Goodbye!
MOB_01A Awright me ol'china! It's Paul. I might have a little result for you, but I need to speak to you in person.
MOB_01B I'm enjoying a little R&R at the Club Malibu.
MOB_01C Reckon you're gonna owe me a favor or two after this, sunshine. I'll see you later.
MOB_02A Hey! Hello, Tommy? Tommy!
MOB_02B We got a situation over at the Print Works. You better go and check it out.
MOB_02C Oh my, some kind of mess or other things are messed up. I gotta go.
MOB_03A Mr. Vercetti? I have here a signed piece of crap
MOB_03B stating that you have taken on all of BJ's Used Auto's debts.
MOB_03C With BJ's sudden disappearance I have no choice, but to hold YOU responsible for his
MOB_03D Until this account is settled in full, you should consider Vice City's streets to be very unfriendly.
MOB_03E financial insecurities.
MOB_03F you should consider Vice City's streets to be very unfriendly.
MOB_04A How you doin' mate? It's Paulo again.
MOB_04B Look Tommy, I forgot to mention we're going to need some extra muscle for the concert. A bit of security.
MOB_04C There's a biker gang led by Mitch Baker, it would be great publicity. Very rock and roll, baby.
MOB_04D Sort this out for me and I'll get you some back stage passes for the gig, awright?
MOB_05A Hey, it's Mitch. You did good Tommy, it's good to have the old girl back.
MOB_05B You tell Kent Paul he'll get his security for the gig.
MOB_05C You have my word on that.
MOB_05D Now keep yourself out of trouble.
MOB_06A Tommy, 'nuf dead man been chattin' about you, my dear.
MOB_06B Thought you might need something to make you feel better. So Auntie Poulet make you some stew, aye?
MOB_06C Come by me kitchen some time, okay Tommy?
MOB_08A Hey Tommy, I thought you might need some business advice.
MOB_08B Once you got the operation up and running, you'll need to drop by and take the week's cash.
MOB_08C Let the guys think they got the run of the place and they'll be shaving the profits - OK?
MOB_08D I know how to handle business, Ken, okay?
MOB_08E Okay, okay. I know, you know. I was just, you know, telling you I know, that
MOB_08F you know, that I know. Just keeping it sharp baby! Keeping it sharp. Oh yeah.
MOB_08G Whatever, Ken, whatever...
MOB_08H Whatever, Ken, whatever...
MOB_09A Hey Leo! I got some work for you!
MOB_09B This ain't Leo.
MOB_09C Hey, if Leo knows you got his phone, he gonna kill you!
MOB_09D Maybe Leo's already dead. Maybe I killed Leo and took his phone - you ever think of that prick?
MOB_09E You killed Leo? You must have big cojones - wanna work for me?!
MOB_09F Drop by my father's cafe in Little Havana and we'll talk mano y mano.
MOB_10A Tommy! Look, I gotta ask you a favor.
MOB_10B Steve! How's filming going!
MOB_10C Fine, fine. I, heh, WE need a car chase scene, but our budget can't stretch to it.
MOB_10D I've left some wheels around town. You'll know what to do.
MOB_10E Okay Steve, I'll keep an eye out. Catch you later.
MOB_11A Howdy son, just thought I'd ring you up and give you some advice.
MOB_11B Hey, Avery. What's eating you?
MOB_11C There's a lot of opportunity in this town if you own the right real estate, you catch my drift?
MOB_11D I reckon so...
MOB_11E All I'm saying is keep your eyes open and you might find the perfect business opportunity. I'll catch y'later.
MOB_11F Later, Avery.
MOB_14A Hey there Tommy, you're gonna love me mate.
MOB_14B A little birdy told me that Vice City SWAT Division has a deposit box at a certain rather large banking establishment,
MOB_14C where they keep all the bribes they've taken over the years, like some kind of old boys' retirement fund.
MOB_14D Of course, if this information should ever help you acquire any of that cash,
MOB_14E I guess you'd feel obliged to push some of it my way?
MOB_14F I'll bear that in mind, thanks Kent.
MOB_14G It's Paul. I'm from Kent, near London, you prat.
MOB_14H Whatever you say, KENT.
MOB_14I My provincial English geography ain't what it was.
MOB_16A Tommy, Paulo here, que pasa amigo?
MOB_16B What do you want Paul? I don't want any fake label clothes.
MOB_16C Very funny, mate, but you know I don't touch bent gear. Nah, I was just calling to see if I get a part in one your movies.
MOB_16D Back in England I did a lot of blue stuff, mate. I'm packing more heat than you, my son.
MOB_16E Paul, thanks for the offer, I'll bear it in mind.
MOB_16F Seriously, don't forget about me, after all I done for you.
MOB_16G That's what I'm trying to forget about.
MOB_17A Tommy Vercetti. How's it going, Mr. 'big shot'? I hear all these things about you, some kind of player in town, now eh?
MOB_17B Paul, you're drunk.
MOB_17C Nah, you stupid prat, I ain't drunk! I only had a couple and some treats, ain't been to bed for a couple of days, you know.
MOB_17D Anyway, don't give me that. I ain't a mug. Who set you up in this town? Who? Me. That's who.
MOB_17F Really?
MOB_17G Don't give me that. Don't! I introduced you to people. I showed you the ropes, did a lot of stuff for you, and this is how you repay me. You ignore me?!
MOB_17H You won't give me a way in, all after I did for you! What do you think I am? A div or something?
MOB_17I Paul, take it easy. I've been busy, don't be an idiot.
MOB_17J I ain't no idiot, mush. That's what they said in borstal. You asking for trouble son, because you're gonna get it!
MOB_17K Tommy, mate. Please. You was my big hope! Please, don't laugh at me!
MOB_17L Errr...Paul, get some sleep, seriously.
MOB_18A Tommy, it's Paulo, how are you? Right mate, anyway, thought I had to drop you a line.
MOB_18B Oh my good lord, my son, you will not believe the quality of the brass I just encountered.
MOB_18C Street walker or something, just down in Little Havana, mate.
MOB_18D Said her name was Mercedes or something.
MOB_18E Oh my god, mate. You gotta check this bird out.
MOB_18F Could strip the lead out of a pencil. Said I was the best she ever had and all.
MOB_18G Keep you potatoes skinned for her. Be seeing you.
MOB_20A Alright, Tommy, it's Paul. I just heard from a mush that you've been a real naughty boy.
MOB_20B Somebody has taken offense to you acting like the big guy all of a sudden, giving it the big shot thing.
MOB_20C Well, don't say I never warned you or nothing. Boasting is a mug's game, son.
MOB_20D Anyway, I heard there's some price been put on your head and someone's going to have a crack at you, so watch yourself,
MOB_20E and remember me, mate.
MOB_24A Hola, is this Mr. Vercetti?
MOB_24B Yeah.
MOB_24C This is Cortez. You were at my party.
MOB_24D Yeah. I remember.
MOB_24E Mr. Vercetti, it was a most unfortunate incident that happened with your business deal.
MOB_24F I know.
MOB_24G I want you to know me and my people are doing their utmost to get to the bottom of it.
MOB_24H If you'd like to talk to me more privately, you can find me at the boat, eh? OK? Good day, senor.
MOB_25A Tommy, Thomas, it's Cortez. Look, the French are giving me all kinds of trouble, amigo.
MOB_25B Damn hypocrites. They spend a hundred years stealing from poor countries
MOB_25C and they call me a thief! Heh..huh?! I am going to need your help as soon as possible, amigo.
MOB_25D So please hurry, eh? Tommy, I need you, all right? I hate the damn French!
MOB_26A Hello, Tommy?
MOB_26B Yeah?
MOB_26C It's Baker. I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the show.
MOB_26D Me and the boys want to thank you, and remind you, you got our respect.
MOB_26E Good day. Keep riding hard, son!
MOB_29A Hello, is this Mr. Tommy Vercetti?
MOB_29B Yes.
MOB_29C Well, I hear through the vine of grapes you the man when someone got a vermin infestation.
MOB_29D Yeah, maybe...
MOB_29E Well, I got a real vermin infestation. Haitians everywhere.
MOB_29F My name is Umberto Robina and I want you to meet me at the Cafe Robina as soon as you can,
MOB_29G 'cause I tell you, these damn Haitians gone too far this time.
MOB_29H Test
MOB_30A Tommy, Umberto Robina.
MOB_30B Hey, how's the cafe?
MOB_30C Oh, wonderful. Incredible, Tommy! Incredible. No wimps, Tommy, just real men, and the beautiful women!
MOB_30D Anyway, I wanted to tell you, me and Papi..to us..you Cuban.
MOB_30E You have proved yourself, man. You got big cojones.
MOB_30F Well thank you, Umberto. Nobody's said that to me since I left jail. See you around.
MOB_33A Tommy, it's Phil, now cut out all the reminiscing crap and listen to me, you hear?
MOB_33B Good. I got me some extra strength boomshine nearing fermentation time and I was wondering if you'd fancy having a shot.
MOB_33C Seriously, Tommy, if you like a drink, or if you need to strip paint, this stuff'll make a man out of you.
MOB_33D Sure did out of me, even though I can't see out of one eye. I'll be waiting for you, y'hear.
MOB_34A Tommy, I really enjoyed working with you. Ain't had so much fun since the ridge in Nam, pal.
MOB_34B Anyhows, you need anything, you call on me, you hear?
MOB_34C I always remember those I served with,
MOB_34D and I am sure I can help you out, you hear?
MOB_35A Tommy, the wound is healing well.
MOB_35B Funny thing is, I have fought in 6 battle zones and always walked away without a scratch, and now this!
MOB_35C One armed Phil. Still, I got me a healthy selection of one-handed firepower so I'll never be unarmed Phil, you hear.
MOB_35D Anyway son, cut out the sentimental crap and go buy yourself a drink, you hear!
MOB_36A Tommy, it's Phil, I want to thank you for helping me out back there son.
MOB_36B Damn Charlie, he'll always ambush you somewhere or other.
MOB_36C Anyway, the wound is healing well, and it means I'll no longer be defrauding the government on my disability check.
MOB_40A Hey Tommy, it's Sonny. How's the sun tan?
MOB_40B I ain't got no sun tan.
MOB_40C Well, you ain't got my money, either. So I'm wondering to myself,
MOB_40D what are you doing? So, tell me, Tommy, what are you doing?
MOB_40E I'm looking for the money, Sonny. Don't worry.
MOB_40F I am worrying, Tommy, that's my style, because I seem to have this problem in my life
MOB_40G with unreliable people.
MOB_40H Don't be an unreliable person, Tommy, please.
MOB_40I Do us both a favor. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
MOB_41A Tommy, remember me?
MOB_41B Hello Sonny.
MOB_41C That's right, Sonny. We're old friends!
MOB_41D You never write me, you never call. Don't you want to be friends no more?
MOB_41E I've been busy trying to sort things out. You didn't give me a lot of support down here, Sonny.
MOB_41F Oh, my fault is it? Well I've heard you been busy all right. Busy killing drug barons!
MOB_41G Busy taking over. Don't forget about us, Tommy.
MOB_41H Because I can assure you, I ain't forgotten 'bout you.
MOB_42A Tommy.
MOB_42B Sonny.
MOB_42C Obviously you are suffering from hearing problems, so I'll try again.
MOB_42D Where's the goddamned money?! Where's the goddamned stuff?! And where's my cut of your new action?!
MOB_42E You are making an idiot out of me, Tommy, and I'm not laughing yet.
MOB_43A Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, I had Sonny on the phone, OK, are you with me?
MOB_43B I don't know about you, but there's something about a man threatening to murder my family which really scares
MOB_43C the crap out of me. What are you gonna do?
MOB_43D Ken, take it easy.
MOB_43E I AM calm, calm as a man can be when he's fearing for his life!
MOB_43F Stay off the idiot fuel and look after yourself.
MOB_43G No one's gonna take us out. I'll see you later.
MOB_43H I am calm. Don't I sound calm? Must be impending death that is doing this to my voice.
MOB_47A Tommy, it's Lance. We got big problems. Come down here right away!
MOB_62A Tommy, is Ricardo Diaz, I want to thank you for looking out for me my man.

MOB_63D Good.
MOB_63E I heard about Lance. What a little prick, eh?
MOB_63F Yes.
MOB_63G Never trust a man who walks the streets in his pajamas. That's what I say. Glad you killed him. I hope it was painful for the prick.
MOB_63H I think it was. You know I just didn't think he was like that...
MOB_63I Tommy, for a raging lunatic, you're pretty naive. I'll be back at work soon, teach you a thing or two about life, you hear.

MOB_72A Tommy, it's me, Lance. Keep your mouth shut there Tommy, 'cause I ain't got time to talk.
MOB_72B I ain't interested in what you got to say. Why should I be? You don't care about me, do you?
MOB_72C You gotta look after me a bit better. Give me a fair slice. You know...
MOB_72D Hey, Tommy, man... Look, I'm sorry. It's just that...
MOB_72E People patronize me all my life, treat me like a little kid.
MOB_72F My brother would do that. Please, man, don't do that!
MOB_72G I gotta go.
MOB_73A Tommy, it's Steve.
MOB_73B Hey, Steve.
MOB_73C Hey indeed, genius. You're a marvel! I'm a marvel! They love us. We are re-writing the record books, pal.

MOB_73E Eeer, that's cool, Steve.
MOB_73F Cool? It's hot, man. Hot. H. O. T. He never believed in me. Never thought I was an artist, and now I've made it.
MOB_73G I'm the best damn skin flick director of all time, my friend. I just wanted to say, it's a pleasure to have met you.
MOB_73H Thanks, Steve.
