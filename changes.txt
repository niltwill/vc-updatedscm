------------------------------

[*] Fixed the appearance of the construction building that you destroy in 'Demolition Man'


------------------------------
{V2.0d}
------------------------------

[*] Patients in the Paramedic side-mission will now only enter the Ambulance when it is stopped (preventing from easy accident killings)

[*] Reverted the Sentinel XS to Sentinel in 'The Driver'


------------------------------
{V2.0c}

[*] Fix phone glitch while picking up the call with different weapons (now should revert to fists when you answer the phone)
[*] You can now skip mobile phone calls (just press the action [TAB] button while the call is ongoing)


------------------------------
{V2.0a}
------------------------------

[*] Timer in taxi mission has been reset to the game's default behavior (don't wanna mess it up with almost always getting speed bonuses)
[*] Taxi, Ambulance, Firefighter sidemission fixes regarding wasted/busted
[*] Firefighter's timer reaching zero should no longer result in a nasty infinite loop (previously making it impossible to restart the mission or get into a new mission and a message will also keep displaying ceaselessly)

[*] Fixed(?) random traffic vehicle passing by in 'Alloy Wheels of Steel' (might be sometimes visible)

[*] Lance will now say "Come on man, drive more careful!" if you damage the Infernus quite some in 'Back Alley Brawl'. (The other with the Strip Club is removed, as it conflicts with the other, there can only be one dialogue and because we first have to buy that before we can even enter it, so it makes no sense for Lance to say that! Not to mention we got sorta introduced to it in the first mission.)
[*] You can now skip tutorial messages and info pickups at the start of the game. Press the SPRINT button to quit the player lock and go on without having to wait a little, or press the ACTION key under 6 seconds to remove help. If no action is taken, game includes help after 6 seconds. This does not have much impact on the game, it's merely an additional option for the seasoned players who don't need this info being repeated.
	In no-help mode, some of these missions' help messages are also disabled:
		- The Party (follow the T-shirt blip)
		- Back Alley Brawl (attacking and sprinting help)
		- Jury Fury (weapon cycling help, hardware store hint)
		- Riot (cycling through targets, weapon drop help, explosive barrel help)

	=> Thanks to Blackbird88
[*] Fixed a player animation stuck bug in 'The Job' (when you get out of the car around the bank area).


------------------------------
{V1.1}
------------------------------

[*] Restored Tommy's speaking animation with the french in "Mall Shoutout" and with Lance in "Guardian Angels" (at the carpark).
[*] Lance now does not disappear instantly in Guardian Angels after the bike ambush (if you ever looked back before getting on the bike, he just vanished without a trace...).
[*] Phnom Penh '86 now includes three additional audio lines: "You sure is better at shooting than talking." and "Thanks. You're a real charmer yourself." and "I know, Tommy."
[*] Supply & Demand now includes the lines: "We made it! Those other boats ain't VIP class." (when reaching the Marquis), "They're matchwood! And fish food!" while damaging the cuban ships, plus "Bridge coming up!" after the jetty part (if the helicopter is still there).
[*] In The Job mission, Tommy now says "New threads, huh? You need more than that, pal!" during the closing cutscene in response to Kent Paul. Also the line from "Yeah, and you'll put somebody's eye out!" is now said after "For god's sake, Phil, stop waving that thing around!"
[*] The wasted and busted info texts now disable player control to make sure you pay attention and explain a little more (like in GTA III). However, it's less meaningful with the HUD disabled (or with custom HUD).
[*] The strippers will no longer repeat their lines forever, and their lines are a little more randomized now.
[*] Fixed some typos in conversation text editings.


------------------------------
{V1.0}
------------------------------

From the Japanese game version, I adopted a few changes:

[*] The message 'Come back when you have finished the Biker gang missions.' is shown for 4 seconds instead of 1
[*] Duration of Pole Position mission complete cutscene is slightly longer.
[*] The Infernus spawn inside the mall is disabled during 'All Hands On Deck!'
[*] The driver of Candy's car in 'Recruitment Drive' can no longer be shot while in the car.
[*] The limo driver and Candy can no longer be shot while in the car in 'Martha's Mug Shot'. In addition, the driver no longer responds to threats and the limo is fireproof.
[*] During 'Cannon Fodder', the player now leaves the taxi slightly before the Cubans, instead of right after.
[*] The Voodoo's with Cubans in 'Trojan Voodoo' are now fireproof, and the Cubans no longer respond to threats.
[*] The Topfun van is set to not be locked in position at the end of 'Bombs Away!'
[*] Bugfix in 'Love Juice' regarding trying to pick up Mercedes. It is now only possible in a car or motorcycle (with exception Pizza Boy/Baggage) as per instructed. No more easy heli rides!
[*] The player is now removed from any vehicle and the vehicle despawned after the intro cutscene in 'Publicity Tour' if he was in one.

Two minor things:

[*] Lance now appears as IGBudy3 instead of the usual IGBuddy in 'Death Row'.
[*] Removed a misplaced pedestrian in the cutscene of the mission 'Messing With the Man' (only his head was visible).

Added some audio lines ingame:

[*] During the mission "The Chase" after the Shark boss gets into the BF injection, Tommy will soon make the remark: "Sick of these pricks!"
[*] During the mission "The Fastest Boat" when you jump in the boat to steal it, you'll hear Jethro and Dwaine lamenting: "He's taking the boat. Bummer.", "Some square's stealing the boat, man!"
[*] During the mission "Death Row", Diaz's goons will taunt you verbally at the junk yard: "Do you think you can get away with this?".
[*] During the mission "Keep your Friends Close", Tommy will now shout "Sonny? SONNY! I'm coming for ya!" in response to Sonny's killing order.
[*] Diaz's butler will greet you before mission cutscenes "The Chase" and the "Phnom Penh '86" (afterwards, you can imagine that Diaz killed or fired him..)
[*] Strippers now say some comments to you in the Pole Position Club when the camera changes, at the private stripteaser room. This might increase the monotonous scene's atmosphere a bit, although it gets repetitive.

Phone call additions:

[*] During Umberto Robina's call, Tommy will now reply with an additional "Yeah, maybe..." when Umberto asks: "wanna work for me?"
[*] Ken Rosenberg now gives you some business advice (after completing the mission 'Shakedown')
[*] Kent Paul rings you up regarding the the SWAT retirement fund which is later seized in the mission 'The Job', happens shortly after you purchase the Malibu Club.
[*] Phil Cassidy now calls after you complete the last storyline mission (Keep your Friends Close)
[*] Mercedes now also rings you up after you complete the mission 'Rub Out'.
[*] Mercedes now rants to you about Jezz Torrent after you complete the mission 'Love Juice'.

Lastly, Tommy is more talkative and says a few more inner-monologues to the player:

[*] After completing the mission 'Death Row'
[*] After completing the mission 'Rub Out'
[*] After initial cutscene of 'Love Juice'
[*] After initial cutscene of 'Spilling the Beans'
[*] After initial cutscene of 'Cap the Collector'
[*] After finishing with Avery's business advice call (after 'Shakedown')
