POR2_A    How's filming going, Steve?
POR2_B    Well, Candy is a natural and that new girl - she's insatiable!
POR2_C    She went through half the cast and crew before I even took a light reading.
POR2_D    Anyway, hey, tomorrow we're going on location to shoot the boat scenes -
POR2_E    Boat scenes?! What boat scenes?
POR2_F    The fishermen are in the throes of passion when this giant shark comes in -
POR2_G    What'd I say about the giant shark?
POR2_H    I said, 'NO GIANT SHARK', alright?
POR2_I    Just keep the cameras pointed at the poontang!
POR2_J    Ok ok, hey Tommy, a guy's gotta try, right?
POR2_K    Get those flyers printed up?
POR2_L    Yeah, but nobody's gonna let us distribute those things, I mean
POR2_M    They're just too, uh, they're unimaginative.
POR2_N    You don't worry about that.
POR2_O    I've got my own ideas for distribution.
POR2_P    O.K. Hey, Candy, uh - in my trailer.
