TEX1_0    ~g~The target is at the driving range enjoying a game of golf. Make sure it's his last.
TEX1_1    ~g~Go and pick up some golfing clothes from Jocksports.
TEX1_10   Kill that Psycho!
TEX1_2    ~g~Now head to the Leaf Links Golf Club.
TEX1_3    Who's this guy? Boys, deal with him.
TEX1_6    Nice ass baby!
TEX1_7    Is this me?
TEX1_8    Each time you enter a caddy you automatically receive a golf club, providing your melee weapon slot is empty.
TEX1_9    Get him!
TEX1_A    Come in and park yourself on the hide, son.
TEX1_B    Hell, my daddy used to say, never look a gift horse in the mouth, and by golly, he never did.
TEX1_C    Would you like a drop of the old Kentucky?
TEX1_D    No thanks.
TEX1_E    A clean thinker! I like that.
TEX1_F    Now, the property business isn't all about high-falootin' paper pushing.
TEX1_G    It's about dirt! And the will to claim that dirt! You with me, son?
TEX1_H    Oh yeah.
TEX1_I    Well, I need some tenacious bastard to let go of some dirt,
TEX1_J    and you look to me like the kind of guy to persuade him.
TEX1_K    Persuasion's my forte.
TEX1_L    Yeh, he'll be down at the country club, down on the golf course.
TEX1_M    They don't allow guns, so his bodyguards won't be packing lawgivers.
TEX1_N    Go beat eight tons of crap out of him.
TEX1_O    Here now - I got you a membership, and boy you're going to need more appropriate clothing.
