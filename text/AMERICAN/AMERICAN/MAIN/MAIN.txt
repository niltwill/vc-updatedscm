MOB12_A   Hey Tommy, it's Avery! Now listen, I got me all tied up at the moment
MOB12_B   and I have a representative of mine needs chaperoning out to the Gator Keys.
MOB12_C   I'm after some land out that way, so I'm sending someone out to sweeten the deal.
MOB12_D   Could you do me a favor and make sure he gets there ok?
MOB12_E   Yeah, sure thing Avery. Where'd you want me to pick him up?
MOB12_F   He's just finishing some business at the building site. I said you'd pick him up from there.
MOB12_G   No problem. See you later, Avery.
MOB13_A   Vercetti? VERCETTI!! Damn you man, you've got to help me!
MOB13_B   Mr. Moffat? How's family life?
MOB13_C   Damn you to hell, HELL, do hear me?!
MOB13_D   Well it was nice chatting...
MOB13_E   WAIT! Wait, Vercetti - Tommy, can I call you Tommy?
MOB13_F   We're both businessmen, yeah? You know a good deal when you hear one, ok?
MOB13_G   I don't have time to chat, get to the point.
MOB13_H   MONEY. Money is the goddamned point.
MOB13_I   I've escaped the coop again, but it's never long before they track me down - they think it's a damned game!
MOB13_J   I'm at a pay phone somewhere in this god forsaken shit hole.
MOB13_K   Get me out of here before they take me back and...and..oh go-o-od...
MOB13_L   Well, I'm busy for the next -
MOB13_M   No! Don't shit with me here, have a heart! No man should have to do such, such things.
MOB13_N   I'm on my knees here Tommy, in the dirt begging you please...
MOB13_O   I guess I could swing by that way, see if I can spot you...
MOB13_P   Oh god, they're coming. For the love of Christ hurry, hurry!
MOB15_A   Tommy, mate, it's Paul, from Kent,
MOB15_B   a couple of proper sorts have your name written all over them, down at the Malibu.
MOB15_C   What are you talking about?
MOB15_D   Sorts. Birds. You know. Girls. Tastey ones, don't think they're brasses or nothing.
MOB15_E   You gotta come check them out.
MOB16_A   Tommy, Paulo here, que pasa amigo?
MOB16_B   What do you want Paul. I don't want any fake label clothes.
MOB16_C   Very funny, mate, but you know I don't touch bent gear.
MOB16_D   Nah, I was just calling to see if I get a part in one your movies,
MOB16_E   back in England I did a lot of blue stuff, mate.
MOB16_F   I'm packing more heat than you, my son.
MOB16_G   Paul, thanks for the offer, I'll bear it in mind.
MOB16_H   Seriously, don't forget about me, after all I done for you.
MOB16_I   That's what I'm trying to forget about.
MOB19_A   Tommy V, It's KP here. Kent Paul. Word on the street is people want to rip you off.
MOB19_B   Keep your eye's peeled, my son. And remember, I didn't say nothing to you about this.
MOB21_A   Tommy, Thomas, it's Cortez. Que pasa?
MOB21_B   Things are interesting. How are you, my friend?
MOB21_C   Tommy, it is always a struggle here. Excuse the poor line, we have just had another failed coup.
MOB21_D   The people are the most demanding mistress of all.
MOB21_E   So far, we have had three revolutions and four coups since I return from Vice City.
MOB21_F   Luckily, I have been promoted each time.
MOB21_G   I wanted to ask you about Mercedes.
MOB21_H   Ok, what about her?
MOB21_I   Oh Tommy, Tommy. I, I hear these stories, all these stories - I don't know what to think.
MOB21_J   Maybe everyone is humiliating me.
MOB21_K   Maybe she thinks she can do what she likes, but Tommy, tell me, is it true?
MOB21_L   but tell me Tommy, is it true?
MOB21_M   Is what true?
MOB21_N   These stories I hear. Is she really going to be a lawyer?
MOB21_O   Oh Tommy, the shame, the shame! You know, we Cortez's are a proud family.
MOB21_P   We would never allow a daughter of ours to become a lawyer. Please tell me it isn't so. I don't think I could take it.
MOB21_Q   Oh Colonel, I can assure you Mercedes is never going to become a lawyer. Don't worry about it.
MOB21_R   Oh thank you, Tommy. Tommy, thank you. The shame would be unbearable. She is a lady, not a parasite, you know.
MOB21_S   I know, colonel.
MOB21_T   Anyway, Tommy, you must excuse me, the new minister of the interior has arrived.
MOB21_U   Many years ago, I killed his father in a failed coup so I must be polite. Good day, amigo.
MOB22_A   Tommy, you are proving very useful, my friend.
MOB22_B   Thanks, Cortez. What about my deal?
MOB22_C   Tommy, I am working tirelessly on your behalf to ensue we get to the bottom of this trench of stinking lies and deceit,
MOB22_D   you have my word on that, but in the meantime,
MOB22_E   please accept the esteemed thanks of my people for your work on our behalf.
MOB45_A   Tommy We gotta talk about stuff.
MOB45_B   What's the problem Lance?
MOB45_C   It's you, my friend, I feel you're not giving me a fair slice.
MOB45_D   And more than that, you been embarrassing me in front of the boys. I can't have that.
MOB45_E   Lance, it ain't like that. You've been making mistakes.
MOB45_F   Tommy, I'm not your message boy. I'm not your running boy.
MOB45_G   Lance, don't screw up, and we won't have any problems. I screw up, you can lay into me any time.
MOB45_H   Tommy, I've done everything for you, you treat me like a fool. Don't do that.
MOB45_I   Lance, I won't rip you off or stab you in the back, okay?
MOB45_J   Just take it easy. This is tough enough without you getting all emotional on me.
MOB45_K   Trust me. Do you hear me, do you hear me?
MOB45_L   I hear you, Tommy, but I can't take this much more.
MOB45_M   Lance, don't be like this. Now I'm warning you.
MOB45_N   Do you hear me? Just relax, take a few days off. Okay? I'll talk to you.
MOB46_A   Yo, Tommy! It's Lance.
MOB46_B   Yeah?
MOB46_C   Oh, nice to hear from you, Lance. Come on, man, be cool, be cool.
MOB46_D   I'm in the middle of something. What do you want?
MOB46_E   Nothing. Just to say, you know. Look Tommy, we can do this thing.
MOB46_F   You and me, no problem. You know what I mean?
MOB46_G   We're going to have to do it, 'cause otherwise, we're going to be dead, Lance.
MOB46_H   We're in too far now. But thanks for the call. I'll speak to you later.
MOB52_A   Hey Leo, I think we got a buyer for Diaz's merchandise.
MOB52_B   You gotta give him a ring, man, set up the deal, you know?
MOB52_C   Where are you now?
MOB52_D   You ok Leo? You sound kinda different.
MOB52_E   Just tell me where you are.
MOB52_F   Who the hell is this? Put Leo on, man!
MOB52_G   Leo's gone away for a while, he left me in charge.
MOB52_H   Screw you, man!
MOB54_A   Hiya Tommy!
MOB54_B   Hi Mercedes, howyadoin'?
MOB54_C   I got a new apartment up in Vice Point
MOB54_D   - thought you might want to drop by sometime.
MOB54_E   I'd love to. I'll catch you later.
MOB55_A   Tommy, it's me.
MOB55_B   Hi Mercedes.
MOB55_C   Tommy, I so bored, when we going to have some fun?
MOB55_D   What do you mean?
MOB55_E   Well, I know you're busy fighting and killing and corrupting people,
MOB55_F   but I just want to have some fun. So don't forget about me, you hear?
MOB56_A   Tommy, I hear you kill Ricardo Diaz.
MOB56_B   there was an unfortunate fire at his mansion.
MOB56_C   I think he burnt to death in an acrylic shirt.
MOB56_D   Tommy, I so proud of you. I knew you were a real man.
MOB56_E   He awful trouser stain of a man, you make me so proud to be your friend.
MOB56_F   No, I know you going to be busy trying to take over this town,
MOB56_G   but don't forget about me, you hear?
MOB57_A   It's merceedes. I no longer love you Tommy.
MOB57_B   I no longer do. Honest. 'cause you no longer nice to Mercedes.
MOB57_C   You no longer treat her like a lady. You ignore me and I hate you.
MOB57_D   I insist you come to see me right away!
MOB58_A   Tommy.
MOB58_B   Hey Mercedes.
MOB58_C   Hey indeed Mr. Tough Guy. I real angry with you Tommy.
MOB58_D   Never make me hang out with Jezz Torrent again.
MOB58_E   He is pathetic. Half way through he starts crying about his doggie
MOB58_F   that died when he was 7 years old and that his mommy never loved him.
MOB58_G   And Tommy. He wear a wig and a bra in private.
MOB58_H   I not very happy with you!
MOB59_A   Ooh Tommy, its Mercedes.
MOB59_B   I just want to say, I have so much fun on that film set.
MOB59_C   Anything else you have like that, you let me know.
MOB59_D   I really mean that. I always wanted to be an actress.
MOB59_E   I think I learn a lot about the dramatic process.
MOB59_F   It so enlightening! Thank you. Thank you. I see you real soon. Adios.
MOB_01A   Awright me ol'china! It's Paul. I might have a little result for you, but I need to speak to you in person.
MOB_01B   I'm enjoying a little R&R at the Club Malibu.
MOB_01C   Reckon you're gonna owe me a favor or two after this, sunshine. I'll see you later.
MOB_02A   Ssssnniiiiffffff Hey! Hello, Tommy? Tommy!
MOB_02B   We got a situation over at the Print Works. You better go and check it out.
MOB_02C   Some kind of mess or other. Things are messed up. I gotta go.
MOB_03A   Mr. Vercetti? I have here a signed piece of crap stating
MOB_03B   that you have taken on all of BJ's Auto's debts.
MOB_03C   With BJ's sudden disappearance I have no choice
MOB_03D   but to hold you responsible for his financial insecurities.
MOB_03E   Until this account is settled in full
MOB_03F   you should consider Vice City's streets to be very unfriendly.
MOB_04A   How you doin' mate? It's Paulo again.
MOB_04B   Look Tommy, I forgot to mention we're going to need some extra muscle for the concert. A bit of security.
MOB_04C   There's a biker gang led by Mitch Baker, it would be great publicity. Very rock and roll, baby.
MOB_04D   Sort this out for me and I'll get you some back stage passes for the gig, awright?
MOB_05A   Hey, it's Mitch. You did good Tommy, it's good to have the old girl back.
MOB_05B   You tell Kent Paul he'll get his security for the gig.
MOB_05C   You have my word on that.
MOB_05D   Now keep yourself out of trouble.
MOB_06A   Tommy, 'nuf dead man been chattin' about you, my dear.
MOB_06B   Thought you might need something to make you feel better. So Auntie Poulet make you some stew, aye?
MOB_06C   Come by me kitchen some time, ok Tommy?
MOB_08A   Hey Tommy, I thought you might need some business advice.
MOB_08B   Once you got an operation up and running, you'll need to drop by and take the week's cash.
MOB_08C   Let the guys think they got the run of the place and they'll try shaving the profits - ok?
MOB_08D   Hey, I know how to handle business, Ken, ok?
MOB_08E   Ok, ok. I know, you know. I know. I was,
MOB_08F   I was just, you know, telling you I know, that you know, that I know.
MOB_08G   Just keeping it sharp baby!
MOB_08H   Whatever, Ken, whatever...
MOB_09A   Hey Leo! I got some work for you!
MOB_09B   This ain't Leo.
MOB_09C   Hey, if Leo knows you got his phone, he gonna kill you!
MOB_09D   Maybe Leo's already dead. Maybe I killed Leo and took his phone - you think of that prick?
MOB_09E   You killed Leo? You must have big cojones - wanna work for me?!
MOB_09F   Drop by my father's cafe in Little Havana and we'll talk mano a mano.
MOB_10A   Tommy! Look, I gotta ask you a favor.
MOB_10B   Steve! How's filming going!
MOB_10C   Fine, fine. I, heh, WE need a car chase scene, but our budget can't stretch to it.
MOB_10D   I've left some wheels around town. You'll know what to do.
MOB_10E   Ok Steve, I'll keep an eye out. Catch you later.
MOB_11A   Howdy son, just thought I'd ring you up and give you some advice.
MOB_11B   Hey, Avery. What's eating you?
MOB_11C   There's a lot of opportunity in this town if you own the right real estate, you catch my drift?
MOB_11D   I reckon so...
MOB_11E   All I'm saying is keep your eyes open and you might find the perfect business opportunity. I'll catch y'later.
MOB_11F   Later, Avery.
MOB_14A   Hey there Tommy, you're gonna love me mate.
MOB_14B   A little birdy told me that Vice City SWAT Division has a deposit box at a certain rather large banking establishment,
MOB_14C   where they keep all the bribes they've taken over the years,
MOB_14D   like some kind of old boys' retirement fund.
MOB_14E   Of course, if this information should ever help you acquire any of that cash,
MOB_14F   I guess you'd feel obliged to push some of it my way?
MOB_14G   I'll bear that in mind, thanks Kent.
MOB_14H   It's Paul. I'm from Kent, near London, you prat.
MOB_14I   My provincial English geography ain't what it was.
MOB_16A   Tommy, Paulo here, que pasa amigo?
MOB_16B   What do you want Paul? I don't want any fake label clothes.
MOB_16C   Very funny, mate, but you know I don't touch bent gear. Nah, I was just calling to see if I get a part in one your movies.
MOB_16D   Back in England I did a lot of blue stuff, mate. I'm packing more heat than you, my son.
MOB_16E   Paul, thanks for the offer, I'll bear it in mind.
MOB_16F   Seriously, don't forget about me, after all I done for you.
MOB_16G   That's what I'm trying to forget about.
MOB_17A   Tommy Vercetti, how's it going, Mr. big shot? I hear all these things about you, some kind of player in town, now eh...
MOB_17B   Paul, you're drunk.
MOB_17C   Nah, you stupid prat, I ain't drunk. I only had a couple and some treats, ain't been to bed for a couple of days, you know.
MOB_17D   Anyway, don't give me that. I ain't a mug. Who set you up in this town? Who? Me. That's who.
MOB_17F   Really?
MOB_17G   Don't give me that. Don't! I introduced you to people. I showed you the ropes, did a lot of stuff for you, and this is how you repay me.
MOB_17H   You ignore me. You won't give me a way in, after all I did for you! What do you think I am? A div or something?
MOB_17I   Paul, take it easy. I've been busy, don't be an idiot.
MOB_17J   I ain't no idiot, mush. That's what they said in borstal. Are you asking for trouble son, because you're going to get it!
MOB_17K   Tommy, mate. Please. You was my big hope! Please, don't laugh at me!
MOB_17L   Paul, get some sleep, seriously.
MOB_18A   Tommy, it's Paulo, how are you? Right mate, anyway, thought I had to drop you a line.
MOB_18B   Oh my good lord, my son, you will not believe the quality of the brass I just encountered.
MOB_18C   Street walker or something, just down in Little Havana, mate.
MOB_18D   Said her name was Mercedes or something.
MOB_18E   Oh my god, mate. You gotta check this bird out.
MOB_18F   Could strip the lead out of a pencil. Said I was the best she ever had and all.
MOB_18G   Keep you potatoes skinned for her. Be seeing you.
MOB_20A   Alright, Tommy, it's Paul. I just heard from a mush that you've been a real naughty boy.
MOB_20B   Somebody has taken offense to you acting like the big guy all of a sudden, giving it the big shot thing.
MOB_20C   Well, don't say I never warned you or nothing. Boasting is a mug's game, son.
MOB_20D   Anyway, I heard there's some price been put on your head and someone's going to have a crack at you,
MOB_20E   so watch yourself, and remember me, mate.
MOB_24A   Hola, is this Mr. Vercetti?
MOB_24B   Yeah.
MOB_24C   This is Cortez. You were at my party.
MOB_24D   Yeah. I remember.
MOB_24E   Mr. Vercetti, it was a most unfortunate incident that happened with your business deal.
MOB_24F   I know.
MOB_24G   I want you to know me and my people are doing their utmost to get to the bottom of it.
MOB_24H   If you'd like to talk to me more privately, you can find me at the boat, eh? Okay? Good day, senor.
MOB_25A   Tommy, Thomas it's Cortez. Look, the French are giving me all kinds of trouble, amigo.
MOB_25B   Damn hypocrites. They spend a hundred years stealing from poor countries and they call me a thief!
MOB_25C   I am going to need your help as soon as possible, amigo.
MOB_25D   So please hurry, Tommy, I need you, all right? I hate the damn French.
MOB_26A   Hello, Tommy?
MOB_26B   Yeah?
MOB_26C   It's Baker. I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the show.
MOB_26D   Me and the boys want to thank you, and remind you,
MOB_26E   you got our respect. Good day. Keep riding hard, son.
MOB_29A   Hello, is this Mr. Tommy Vercetti?
MOB_29B   Yes.
MOB_29C   Well, I hear through the vine of grapes you the man when someone got a vermin infestation.
MOB_29D   Maybe...
MOB_29E   Well, I got a real vermin infestation. Haitians everywhere.
MOB_29F   My name is Umberto Robina and I want you to meet me at the Cafe Robina as soon as you can,
MOB_29G   'cause I tell you, these damn Haitians gone too far this time.
MOB_29H   Test
MOB_30A   Tommy, is Umberto Robina
MOB_30B   Hey, how's the cafe?
MOB_30C   Oh, wonderful. Incredible. Tommy, incredible. No wimps, Tommy, just real men, and the beautiful women!
MOB_30D   Anyway, I wanted to tell you, me and Papi, to us, you Cuban.
MOB_30E   You have proved yourself, man. You got big cojones.
MOB_30F   Well thank you, Umberto. Nobody's said that to me since I left jail. I'll see you around.
MOB_33A   Tommy, it's Phil, now cut out all the reminiscing crap and listen to me, you hear?
MOB_33B   Good. I got me some extra strength boomshine nearing fermentation time and I was wondering if you'd fancy having a shot.
MOB_33C   Seriously, Tommy, if you like a drink, or if you need to strip paint, this stuff'll make a man out of you.
MOB_33D   Sure did out of me, even though I can't see out of one eye. I'll be waiting for you, y'hear.
MOB_34A   Tommy, I really enjoyed working with you. Ain't had so much fun since the ridge in Nam, pal.
MOB_34B   Anyhows, you need anything, you call on me, you hear?
MOB_34C   I always remember those I served with,
MOB_34D   and I am sure I can help you out, you hear?
MOB_35A   Tommy, the wound is healing well. Funny thing is,
MOB_35B   I have fought in 6 battle zones and always walked away without a scratch, and now this!
MOB_35C   One armed Phil. Still, I got me a healthy selection of one handed fire power so I'll never be unarmed Phil, you hear.
MOB_35D   Any way son, cut out the sentimental crap and go buy yourself a drink, you hear!
MOB_36A   Tommy, it's Phil, I want to thank you for helping me out back there son,
MOB_36B   Damn Charlie, he'll always ambush you somewhere or other,
MOB_36C   Anyway the wound is healing well, and it means I'll no longer be defrauding the government on my disability check.
MOB_40A   Hey Tommy, it's Sonny. How's the sun tan?
MOB_40B   I ain't got no sun tan.
MOB_40C   Well, you ain't got my money, either, so I'm wondering to myself,
MOB_40D   what are you doing? So, tell me, Tommy, what are you doing?
MOB_40E   I'm looking for the money, Sonny. Don't worry.
MOB_40F   I am worrying, Tommy, that's my style,
MOB_40G   because I seem to have this problem in my life with unreliable people.
MOB_40H   Don't be an unreliable person, Tommy, please.
MOB_40I   Do us both a favor. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
MOB_41A   Tommy, remember me?
MOB_41B   Hello Sonny.
MOB_41C   That's right, Sonny. We're old friends,
MOB_41D   You never write me, you never call. Don't you want to be friends no more?
MOB_41E   I've been busy trying to sort things out. You didn't give me a lot of support down here, Sonny.
MOB_41F   Oh, my fault is it? We'll I've heard you been busy all right.
MOB_41G   Busy killing drugs barons. Busy taking over.
MOB_41H   Don't forget about us, Tommy, 'cause I can assure you, I ain't forgotten about you.
MOB_42A   Tommy.
MOB_42B   Sonny.
MOB_42C   Obviously you are suffering from hearing problems, so I'll try again.
MOB_42D   Where's the goddamned money, where's the goddamned stuff, and where's my cut of your new action?
MOB_42E   You are making an idiot out of me, Tommy, and I'm not laughing yet.
MOB_43A   Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, I had Sonny on the phone, ok, are you with me?.
MOB_43B   I don't know about you, but there's something about a man threatening to murder my family
MOB_43C   which really scares the crap out of me. What are you going to do?
MOB_43D   Ken, take it easy.
MOB_43E   I AM calm, calm as a man can be when he's fearing for his life!
MOB_43F   Stay off the idiot fuel and look after yourself.
MOB_43G   No one's gonna take us out. I'll see you later.
MOB_43H   I am calm. Don't I sound calm? Must be impending death that is doing this to my voice.
MOB_47A   Tommy, Lance, we got big problems. Come down here. Right away.
MOB_62A   Tommy, is Ricardo Diaz, I want to thank you for looking out for me my man.
MOB_62B   I ask that prick Cortez, he say you the real deal, my friend, why you not come see me.
MOB_62C   I need a guy like you. All I have now is dickheads,
MOB_62D   dickheads everywhere, yo. I make you real rich.
MOB_63A   Tommy, it's Earnest. Earnest Kelly.
MOB_63B   How are you?
MOB_63C   I'm doing okay. I'll need a stick to walk, but I should be back at work soon enough.
MOB_63D   Good.
MOB_63E   I heard about Lance. What a little prick, eh?
MOB_63F   Yes.
MOB_63G   Never trust a man who walks the streets in his pajamas. That's what I say. Glad you killed him. I hope it was painful for the prick.
MOB_63H   I think it was. I just didn't think he was like that...
MOB_63I   Tommy, for a raging lunatic, you're pretty naive. I'll be back at work soon, teach you a thing or two about life, you hear.
MOB_63J   Take your time, Earnest. Look after yourself.
MOB_66A   Tommy, Tommy why you coming back here for?
MOB_66B   I tell you we don't want to see you around here no more.
MOB_67A   Tommy, me thinks you should be staying away, you hear?
MOB_67B   The Haitian boys not too 'appy with you.
MOB_68A   Tommy son, have I got a surprise for you
MOB_68B   I'm down at the recording studios with some major artists
MOB_68C   Why don't you pay us a visit?
MOB_68D   You know it makes sense, dontcha? See ya later.
MOB_70A   Tommy, it's me, Colonel Cortez. Look senor, I believe you are a man who can get things done. So please help me.
MOB_70B   You can find me at the boat.
MOB_72A   Tommy, it's me, Lance. Keep your mouth shut there Tommy, 'cause I ain't got time to talk.
MOB_72B   I ain't interested in what you got to say. Why should I be? You don't care about me, do you?
MOB_72C   You gotta look after me a bit better. Give me a fair slice. You know...
MOB_72D   Tommy... oh, look, man, I'm sorry. It's just that...
MOB_72E   People patronize me all my life, treat me like a little kid.
MOB_72F   My brother would do that. Please, man, don't do that.
MOB_72G   I gotta go.
MOB_73A   Tommy, it's Steve.
MOB_73B   Hey, Steve.
MOB_73C   Hey indeed, genius. You're a marvel! I'm a marvel! They love us. We are re-writing the record books, pal.
MOB_73D   We are talking major awards here. Finally, I can put my dad in a home an tell him to shut up.
MOB_73E   Eeer, that's cool, Steve.
MOB_73F   Cool? It's hot, man. Hot. H. O. T. He never believed in me. Never thought I was an artist, and now I've made it.
MOB_73G   I'm the best damn skin flick director of all time, my friend. I just wanted to say, it's a pleasure to have met you.
MOB_73H   Thanks steve.
MOB_73I   I love you, baby. Don't go changing on me, you hear.
