GEN1_B    Colonel.
GEN1_C    Thank you for coming. Please sit. Lobster?
GEN1_D    No - thanks.
GEN1_E    I'm ashamed to admit that one of the causes of our mutual problem appears to have been the loose tongue of a man I used to trust.
GEN1_F    I've been carrying Gonzalez for years, but now his incompetence reaches new heights!
GEN1_G    It is only right that you kill Gonzalez...
GEN1_H    Did he do it? It's the money that's important to me.
GEN1_I    For this kindness I'll reward you, and then we will find your money together.
GEN1_J    He will be at his Penthouse, half drunk probably. Use this...
