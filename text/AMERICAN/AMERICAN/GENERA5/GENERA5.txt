COL5A_1   Circumstances force a hasty departure, amigo.
COL5A_2   What's the problem?
COL5A_3   Ehh, the French want their missile technology back and after that last incident,
COL5A_4   I feel it is time to find safer harbors.
COL5A_5   Wouldn't it be safer to fly?
COL5A_6   I'd be dead before I reached check-in. Besides, I need to get my merchandise out of the country.
COL5A_7   Need another gun?
COL5A_8   You, my friend, are worth ten guns...
COL5B_1   Thomas, you have protected and served me well.
COL5B_2   But now you must leave us before we reach the open seas.
COL5B_3   I will lower my personal launch. Keep it, my friend, a token of my gratitude.
COL5B_4   Thank you, Colonel.
COL5B_5   One more request. While I'm away, could you keep an eye on Mercedes for me?
COL5B_6   I think she could look after herself, but sure, I'll keep an eye out.
COL5B_7   Gracias, amigo. Hasta luego.
COL5B_8   Adios, amigo.
