CNT2_B1   Alright, the courier's moving the plates from the docks today.
CNT2_B2   I'm gonna go intercept them, grab the plates, lose any heat, and make my way back here.
CNT2_B3   Now. Depending how well this goes,
CNT2_B4   we may have five minutes to print the money before the counterfeit syndicate finds us, or we may have all year.
CNT2_B5   Either way, I want green rolling off the presses five minutes after I get back. Got it?
CNT2_B6   Don't you worry Tommy. We'll be ready.
CNT2_B7   Me an'the boys will be around in the neighborhood case you need any heat taken care of.
CNT2_B8   All right, everybody cool? All right. I'll catch you later...
