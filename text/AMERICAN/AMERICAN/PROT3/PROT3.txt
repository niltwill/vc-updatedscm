PRO3_01   Ok Lance, let's get the cops' attention!
PRO3_02   ~g~ Take a cop car and go and plant the bomb at the Tarbrush Coffee Shop in the Mall.
PRO3_03   ~g~ You've left Lance behind, go and get him.
PRO3_04   ~g~ Let's go.
PRO3_05   ~r~You killed Lance!
PRO3_07   ~g~ You have blown your cover. Hurry up and plant the bomb!
PRO3_08   ~g~ Get back to ~h~Vercetti Estate~g~ on ~h~Starfish Island~g~.
PRO3_09   Tie 'em up and gag 'em!
PRO3_10   Ooo. Fits perfectly!
PRO3_11   Bit tight around the crotch though...
PRO3_12   Oh yeah yeah, mine too. Mine too.
PRO3_13   Easy brother! No cop drives this bad!
PRO3_14   Remember - smile at the other cops
PRO3_15   Hey there officer. Nice badge, nice badge.
PRO3_16   Real smooth, Lance.
PRO3_17   Ok, timers are set, 5 seconds and ticking.
PRO3_18   5 seconds?!! We got to get the hell out of here!
PRO3_19   Now that got them really irritated.
PRO3_20   ~g~ Get two cops to follow you into the garage.
PRO3_21   ~g~Get a wanted level so the cops will follow you into the lock-up.
PRO3_22   ~g~The lock-up door is blocked! You need to clear the door so it can close.
PRO3_23   ~g~Walk into the marker to plant the bomb.
PRO3_24   ~g~Get clear of the Cafe!
PRO3_A    You moron! What were you thinking?!
PRO3_A1   Alright.
PRO3_B    Do you realize what this means?!
PRO3_C    We could all be sunk!
PRO3_D    The timer must have got screwed.
PRO3_E    That place was wired to go up like a firework factory.
PRO3_F    Then somebody tipped off the cops...
PRO3_G    What's the problem, fellas?
PRO3_H    Mike was supposed to torch some place in the mall,
PRO3_I    but he screwed the fuses and now the cops are crawling all over it.
PRO3_J    We gotta get our stuff and get out of here!
PRO3_K    Relax, both of you, let me think for a second!
PRO3_L    Tommy Vercetti just doesn't cut and run.
PRO3_M    The cops are gonna be going over that building with a fine toothed comb, right?
PRO3_N    But that takes time.
PRO3_O    We gotta go in and torch that place ourselves.
PRO3_P    Yeah, but...
PRO3_Q    No one but a cop could get within a mile of that place!
PRO3_R    So we go as cops.
PRO3_S    We gotta get uniforms - and we're gonna need a squad car.
PRO3_T    All thanks to you Mike.
PRO3_U    I'm sorry.
PRO3_V    I got it.
PRO3_W    What we got to do is lure the cops in with the finger,
PRO3_X    put them in a lock-up
PRO3_Y    and jump 'em.
PRO3_Z    Good plan. Let's go!
