PRO2_04   These idiots operate out of DBP Security around the block.
PRO2_05   You guys just sort it out amongst yourselves.
PRO2_06   I'll be seeing you later.
PRO2_07   Yeah, yeah, whatever.
PRO2_08   ~g~DBP Security will know you are on your way, go and get them before they clear out.
PRO2_09   ~g~Go and speak to the Front Page Bar Owner.
PRO2_10   ~g~Two more have made a run for it. Track them down and finish this.
PRO2_11   Get in the car, useless.
PRO2_A    What's the problem?
PRO2_B    Some bar is refusing to pay.
PRO2_C    They reckon they're protected by a local gang of thugs.
PRO2_D    But don't worry Tommy, I can handle it.
PRO2_E    You call this handling it?
PRO2_F    You two, off your asses...
PRO2_G    Let's go.
