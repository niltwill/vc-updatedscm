INTB_A    Tommy! Tommy, it's been too long.
INTB_B    Hello Sonny.
INTB_C    I know, I know. You're just overwhelmed with emotion.
INTB_D    Fifteen years - seems like only yesterday.
INTB_E    I guess that's a perspective thing.
INTB_F    Hey, doing time for the family is no piece of cake,
INTB_G    but the family looks after its own, ok?
INTB_H    So, how'd the deal go down - you sitting on some white gold?
INTB_I    Look Sonny, we were set up. The deal was an ambush. Harry and Lee are dead.
INTB_J    You better be kidding me Tommy. Tell me you still got the money.
INTB_K    ...no Sonny...I don't have the money.
INTB_L    That was my money, Tommy, MY MONEY!
INTB_M    You better not be screwing me Tommy because you know I'm not a man to be screwed with!
INTB_N    Wait Sonny.
INTB_O    You have my personal assurance that I'm going to get your money back and the drugs.
INTB_P    And I'm gonna mail you the dicks of those responsible.
INTB_Q    Hey, I already know that. You're not a fool Tommy, but I warn you, neither am I.
INTB_R    If it was anybody else you'd be DEAD already.
INTB_S    But because it's you, because we got history, I'm gonna let you handle this.
INTB_T    Look, Sonny, you got my word.
INTB_U    I'll be in touch.
